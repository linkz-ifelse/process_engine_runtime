- an x86 computer

## Setup demo database without docker

navigate to the folder in which the scripts are located and execute the
included script `setup_db_linux_unix.sh`. It will run the necessary SQL
commands to create the database "procesengine" and the role "admin".

  --format plain \
  --file "user.sql" \
  --host localhost \
  --no-password \
  --port 5432 \
  --table "public.\"User\"" "processengine"
  --username "admin" \
  --verbose \
```
